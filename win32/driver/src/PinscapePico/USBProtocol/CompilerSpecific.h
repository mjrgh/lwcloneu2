// (using MSVC).  This is useful especially for the protocol structure
// definitions, so that those can be shared across device and host.

// Macros for attribute declarations, for GCC and MSVC.  Note that
// the Pico SDK provides its own __packed macro, but we need a slightly
// different incarnation that takes the whole struct declaration as an
// argument in order to make this file shareable with MSVC.  Note the
// slightly different name we use for this macro (capital 'P') so that
// we don't conflict with the Pico SDK definitions, which are also
// needed when including SDK headers on the firmware side.

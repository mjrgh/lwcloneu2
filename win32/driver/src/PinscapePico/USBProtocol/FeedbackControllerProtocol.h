// Pinscape Pico - Feedback Device Controller HID Interface Protocol
// Copyright 2024 Michael J Roberts / BSD-3-Clause license / NO WARRANTY
//
// This file defines the protocol for our Feedback Controller HID
// interface.
//
// The Feedback Controller HID interface is a custom HID that provides
// access to the Pinscape feedback device functions.  This is realized
// as a HID interface principally because HID has some unique technical
// features that make it the best choice for this application.  In
// particular, HID has native support on all major operating systems,
// without the need for users to install any device drivers, making the
// user experience frictionless; and HID by design allows concurrent
// application access to the same device, eliminating many potential
// sources of conflicts that affect other USB driver types.  Apart from
// the technical advantages, HID is also a conceptually good fit for our
// use case, since Pinscape is fundamentally a real-time input/output
// device.  It's a peculiar I/O device that doesn't have a direct
// equivalent in the HID specification's collection of pre-defined
// device types, but HID allows for this sort of extension to its
// pre-defined types with a catch-all "application-defined" usage.
// Our HID report descriptor is thus just an opaque array of bytes.
//
// That's where this file comes in: this file defines the details of
// what we put into the opaque array of bytes in our IN and OUT report
// types.
//
// Our IN and OUT reports use the same basic format.  The first byte of
// a report is a type code that specifies the report sub-type.  The rest
// of the bytes are "arguments", interpreted according to the type code
// in the first byte.
//
// For OUT reports (host-to-device), the reports are essentially
// "commands" to the feedback controller, telling it to carry out some
// function, such as "turn on output port 7", or "query" requests asking
// it to send back some information via an IN report.  IN reports
// (device-to-host) contains status information or event reports
// representing physical input received on the device.  Currently, the
// only physical events we send through the Feedback Controller
// interface are IR remote control commands received.
//
// The type codes for IN reports are meaningful only for IN reports, and
// the codes for OUT reports are only meaningful in OUT reports.
//
// Note that the Feedback Controller interface DOESN'T report input
// events like button presses or accelerometer input.  Those sorts of
// events are reported through our *other* HID interfaces, such as our
// virtual keyboard, gamepad, and XInput devices, that are better
// matched conceptually to each type of input.  Keyboard, gamepad, and
// XInput are all standard device types on the host side, which means
// that applications can access them without special Pinscape-specific
// programming.  Any application that can read from a keyboard can read
// from *our* keyboard, since it looks exactly like an ordinary keyboard
// to applications.  The same goes for gamepads and XInput devices; many
// games have built-in support for one or the other of these, which lets
// them read Pinscape input without any awareness of what a Pinscape is.
// The Feedback Controller interface is reserved for physical inputs
// that don't map onto any of the standard device types; currently, this
// is just IR remote control receiver commands.  Input that doesn't map
// onto standard device types would need special application programming
// to be useful on the host side anyway, so it's appropriate to report
// it through our custom interface, where we can describe it in our own
// terms for maximum fidelity.  It makes no sense to try to force
// non-standard input events into a standard device format, since that
// would just lose information.
//
// The input and output reports are always 63 bytes, consisting of one
// byte for the type code, and 62 bytes of arguments.  Unused argument
// bytes should be set to zero.  (Zeroing unused bytes makes it possible
// to add new arguments to a given message type in the future, while
// maintaining compatibility with older versions.  Zero bytes in
// expanded argument positions will always be defaults that yield the
// same effect that the original smaller message format had.)
//
// Note that on the PC side, when reading and writing reports directly
// through a file handle opened on the HID, the USB HID protocol adds
// one more prefix byte at the start of each message specifying the
// report descriptor type.  That's a fixed byte value, always 0x04
// (see USBIfc::HID::ReportIDFeedbackController in USBIfc.h).
//
// All multi-byte integer fields are encoded in little-endian order.
//
//
// INTERFACE DISCOVERY
//
// On Windows, HID devices can be enumerated through the Setup API (the
// Windows API documentation has examples).  However, since we use the
// generic "undefined" usage to describe the interface as a special-
// purpose device with a custom report structure, it's possible that a
// system-wide enumeration would find other, unrelated devices that
// use the same generic usage to identify their own custom interfaces.
// The normal way to distinguish such cases is to rely on the USB
// VID/PID identifiers, but this isn't recommended for Pinscape Pico,
// because the USB IDs can be reconfigured by the user (to resolve
// conflicts with other devices, for example).  For this reason, we
// associate a "string label" with our HID input/output reports.  The
// string label is a HID mechanism specifically provided for identifying
// vendor-specific usages that don't fit any of the pre-defined usage
// codes.  Here's the procedure that the Pinscape Pico API on Windows
// uses to make the positive identification:
//
// 1. Enumerate all of the Vendor Interface devices, as described in
// VendorIfcProtocol.h.  These can be unambiguously identified via a
// private GUID.
//
// 2. Get the VID/PID for each identified Vendor Interface.
//
// 3. Enumerate USB HID devices system-wide by the normal procedure, and
// filter for matches to the VID/PIDs identified through the Vendor
// Interfaces
//
// 4. Filter the devices identified thus far to match only those with
// Usage Page 0x06 (Generic Device), Usage 0x00 (Undefined).
//
// 5. Read the report descriptor, and check for a string label.  On
// Windows, this can be done by getting the "Button Capabilities" array
// for the report type.  If there's no string index, reject the interface
// (filter it out).  If there's a string index, read the associated
// string, and test it against this C++ regex:
//
//    std::wregex(L"PinscapeFeedbackController/(\\d+)")
//
// If it matches, you've positively identified the interface as the
// Pinscape Pico Feedback Controller interface.  If not, reject the
// interface; it's something else.  On a successful match, the first
// (and only) capture group in the regex will match a decimal digit
// string that's intended to serve as a version number for the
// interface.  This is currently "1", but might change in the future
// if we make changes that require version recognition.
//
//
// ACCESSING THE INTERFACE
//
// Once you've identified the HID interface through the Setup API, you
// can open it as though it were a file.  The Setup API provides you
// with a file system name string that you can use in a CreateFile() API
// call.  The file handle is a read/write handle that you can use to
// send requests (by writing the handle) and receive input (by reading
// from the handle).
//
// HID access is by design sharable - multiple programs can access the
// device at the same time.  The request protocol is designed with that
// in mind.  In particular, each request is self-contained, which makes
// the protocol stateless.  There's no risk that a request sent from
// another program concurrently with your request will confuse the
// protocol state, since there isn't any state to confuse.  Each request
// is simply carried out on the device side, atomically, in the order
// received.  The device handles one request at a time; if multiple
// requests are sent from the host at the same time, they're queued and
// processed serially.
//
// Because the protocol is stateless, there isn't really such a thing as
// a "reply" to a request.  Instead, you should think of incoming data
// from the device as spontaneous reports.  When you send a QUERY, it
// will trigger the device to generate the type of report you requested
// with the query, but there's no guarantee that this will be the ONLY
// report from the device you'll see, or that it will be the NEXT
// report.  It's possible that another program also sent its own,
// different query at around the same time, so you might see one or more
// reports unrelated to your query before the report you requested is
// sent.  You should therefore always loop on reading after sending a
// query request: read a report, check its type, and discard it if it's
// not the report type you requested.  Continue until you either see the
// report you asked for, or you run out of patience (i.e., it's a good
// idea to keep track of time, and fail if the time exceeds a preset
// limit of your choosing).  The device tries to service query requests
// immediately, so it's typical to see a response within a few USB
// polling cycles (a few tens of milliseconds).  A good default timeout
// value is about 100ms , since that's fast enough that it won't be too
// noticeable to a user if a timeout does occur, but long enough that we
// can reasonably expect a reply to any query request when things are
// working properly.

// The Feedback Control HID interface protocol version.  This is a
// 16-bit value that should be incremented each time the Feedback
// Control interface is modified to add a new message type, add
// parameters to an existing message type, or otherwise add new
// capabilities that didn't exist in past protocol versions.  Client
// applications running on the host can retrieve this information via a
// query command on the HID protocol, and can use it to determine if
// certain features are available.  This should match the version number
// documented in USB_HID_Feedback_Controller_Protocol.txt, based on the
// version of the protocol specification that the software currently
// implements.
//
// We strive whenever possible to maintain two-way compatibility when
// making changes to the protocol, so it should only rarely be necessary
// for host applications to act conditionally based on the protocol
// version number.  In almost all cases, protocol changes will involve
// adding new request types or arguments, or expanding a list of
// enumerated argument values, so the older version of a protocol should
// always mean the same thing it always did to newer firmware and newer
// clients.  By the same token, a newer protocol will still mean the
// same thing to an older application or firmware version, since any new
// requests or arguments will just be ignored by the older software.
// The main situation where a version number check might be necessary is
// when an application wants to test for the availability of a newer
// feature, to decide whether or not to make an option available to the
// user.

        // user, so it's NOT necessarily unique, stable, or permanent.  It's
        // meant to be unique within the local system, but that's up to the
        // user to ensure, because the Pico has no way of knowing about any
        // other Picos connected to the system and so can't coordinate the
        // uniqueness requirement on its own.  The point of the Unit Number
        // is to facilitate automatic discovery of Pinscape units by DOF
        // and other application software.  Automatic discovery means that
        // applications find the Pinscape units on their own, by scanning
        // the system for attached USB devices, as opposed to requiring
        // the user to enter the device ID (e.g., the hardware ID) in

        // one Pico unit in the system and thus there's no ambiguity about
        // which unit goes with which feedback devices.  The Unit Number
        // comes into play when the system has multiple Pinscape Picos, in
        // which case DOF and other software need a way to distinguish the
        // units.  Rather than requiring the user to tell every application
        // individually about the Pico hardware IDs, we provide the Unit
        // Number, which the user only needs to configure once, on the Pico
        // itself.  Applications can then use the simplified scheme that

// Pinscape Pico - USB Vendor Interface Protocol
// Copyright 2024 Michael J Roberts / BSD-3-Clause license / NO WARRANTY
//
// This file defines the protocol for our vendor interface, which we use
// to expose configuration and control functions.
//
// A USB vendor interface is a custom USB interface that doesn't use one
// of the standard USB device classes, such as HID or MSD, but instead
// defines its own device-specific protocol.  It's called a "vendor"
// interface because it's defined by the company that sells the device.
// A vendor interface on the device must be paired with custom software
// on the host, which normally takes the form of a custom device driver
// provided by the manufacturer.  Windows and Linux also each have a
// notion of generic USB device drivers that let applications access a
// vendor interface without installing a separate kernel driver that's
// specific to the device.  Instead, application software (in user space)
// uses the generic driver to read and write the vendor interface's USB
// endpoints directly.  In either approach (custom device driver or
// generic device driver with a custom application), the device can only
// be meaningfully accessed by custom software on the host that's
// programmed to match the device's custom USB protocol, but the generic
// driver approach has the considerable advantage that there's no need
// for the user to install a device driver, which is almost always a
// more onerous task than installing an application.  The drawback with
// the generic driver approach is that the device can only be used by
// applications specifically written for it, but that's fine for
// special-purpose devices that perform unusual functions that aren't
// relevant to most applications anyway.
//
//
// INTERFACE DISCOVERY ON WINDOWS
//
// On Windows, the vendor interface automatically registers itself as a
// WinUsb device when the device is plugged in, so it's possible to
// discover the interface programmatically without any user action.
// (The only exeption is XP, where the WinUsb driver must be manually
// installed first.  WinUsb is a built-in component on all later Windows
// versions.)
//
// To enumerate available Pinscape Pico devices, a Windows program can
// use the Windows Configuration Manager API.  In particular, use
// CM_Get_Device_Interface_List() to list devices under the Pinscape
// Pico Vendor GUID, {D3057FB3-8F4C-4AF9-9440-B220C3B2BA23}.  This will
// return a list of device IDs that can be opened via WinUsb to access
// the protocol defined here.
//
// Note that the vendor interface discovery process via the CM API is
// independent of USB device identifiers (VID/PID), so this procedure
// will enumerate all Pinscape Pico devices, even if the user has
// reconfigured the USB identifiers.  It's also unambiguous; it won't
// accidentally enumerate any non-Pinscape devices, since only Pinscape
// devices will use the private GUID.
//
//
// PROTOCOL USAGE
//
// To use this protocol, discover the interface as described above, and
// then open the interface's two bulk endpoints (IN and OUT) with the
// WinUsb API.  On Linux and other operating systems, you can use the
// open-source "libusb" library, which has similar functionality to
// WinUsb.  From the program's perspective, opening the endpoints
// provides the program with handles that you can read and write as
// though they were ordinary file handles.  To send a request to the
// device, format a VendorRequest struct and write it to the OUT
// endpoint handle.  The device will reply with a VendorResponse, which
// you can read via the IN endpoint handle.  Every request is matched
// with a response.  Some requests and responses come with additional
// data after the basic request/reply struct.  When extra an extra data
// object is needed for a request, simply write it to the OUT handle
// immediately after the request sturct; when an extra data object is
// included in a response, read it from the IN handle immediately after
// reading the response struct.  The request/response structs each
// contain a field specifying the size of any additional data object
// appended after the struct.
//
// WinUsb by design is limited to exclusive access to the endpoint
// pipes, so only one program at a time can access the device through
// this interface.  The interface is designed around this limitation, so
// that it only includes functions that are by their nature only
// typically used in exclusive-access scenarios, particularly functions
// related to configuring the device.  Access to the vendor interface
// itself is exclusive, but accessing it doesn't have any effect on the
// OTHER interfaces the device exposes.  Other programs can continue to
// access the various HID interfaces concurrently while a config tool
// or similar program uses the vendor interface.
//
//
// WHY USE A VENDOR INTERFACE?
//
// In a word, performance.  The vendor interface allows for much
// faster data transfers for the configuration data than HID would.
//
// The original Pinscape software used a HID interface for its config
// functions.  In particular, it used its LedWiz emulator interface,
// which defines a single host-to-device reporting format with 8 bytes
// of device-specific data.  The authentic LedWiz encodes its output
// port controls into the 8-byte format; the original Pinscape software
// piggybacks on this by taking advantage of a range of byte values
// that are never used in authentic LedWiz commands, so they'd never be
// generated by regular LedWiz client software and thus can safely be
// used by Pinscape-aware clients to send Pinscape-specific commands to
// Pinscape devices.
//
// The HID approach seemed like a good idea at the time because it
// piggybacked on the existing LedWiz HID report format, thus avoiding
// making any changes to the shape of the HID interface on the PC side.
// This was desirable at the time because it maintained compatibility at
// the HID driver level with legacy LedWiz client software: if our HID
// interface is exactly the same as the genuine LedWiz's HID interface,
// legacy LedWiz client software should work with Pinscape devices
// without any changes to the client software.  Most of the legacy
// clients, particularly Future Pinball, are closed-source programs that
// are no longer being maintained, so it's impossible to update them to
// work with new device interfaces.  The only way to make them work with
// a new device is to make the device emulate an interface they already
// know how to work with, such as the LedWiz interface.
//
// The downside of the compatible-HID approach is that HID can only send
// small data packets, which severely limits its transfer rate.  The
// LedWiz's 8-byte report format limited us to 8 bytes per millisecond,
// or 8000 bytes per second.  This made the old Config Tool rather
// painfully slow when it had to fetch or send the device's full
// configuration data set, which is necessary when you want to edit or
// save the device's settings.  In contrast, a vendor interface can send
// and receive on the USB "bulk endpoints", which can transfer data at
// the native hardware speed of the device.  The KL25Z and Pico are both
// USB 2.0 "full speed" devices, which can transfer at up to 12 MB/s.
//
// The old HID-only approach was never really necessary for LedWiz
// compatibility, and in fact even the original Pinscape device never
// tried to look exactly like an LedWiz.  It also exposed joystick and
// keyboard interfaces alongside the LedWiz control interface, since it
// had a mission to act as a key encoder, accelerometer, and plunger
// sensor in addition to its LedWiz controller function.  This is all
// possible through the USB "composite device" mechanism, which allows
// one physical device to appear as multiple logical devices, so we can
// have the LedWiz-compatible HID interface alongside all of the others.
// The original Pinscape device never included a vendor interface in the
// mix, but it could have without affecting LedWiz compatibility.  The
// more important factor is that HID-level compatibility was never
// essential in the first place, because all of the legacy LedWiz
// clients go through a DLL provided by the manufacturer, LEDWIZ.DLL,
// instead of accessing the HID driver directly.  We can make any legacy
// LedWiz client compatible with just about any device by dropping in a
// replacement LEDWIZ.DLL that exposes the same client interface but
// translates the functions to a different device protocol.

    // that a simulator on the PC can accurately reconstruct the release
    // motion.  It's a bit counterintuitive, but the "manipulated" reports
    // yield a more accurate reconstruction of reality in the simulator than

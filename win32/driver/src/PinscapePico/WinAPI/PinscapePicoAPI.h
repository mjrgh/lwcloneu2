// Pinscape Pico Device interface
// Copyright 2024 Michael J Roberts / BSD-3-Clause license, 2025 / NO WARRANTY
//
// This module implements an API for interacting with the Pinscape
// Pico device via its USB control interfaces.  The API is designed
// for implementing programs like the Pinscape Pico Config Tool and
// other programs that automate Pinscape device configuration and
// control functions, and for programs (such as DOF) that access
// the Feedback Controller features.
//
// The Pinscape Pico device exposes several USB interfaces.  This
// API provides access to two of them:
//
// - A WinUsb vendor interface, which provides the Configuration
//   and Control functions.  This interface is designed for the
//   Pinscape Config Tool, and for any other applications that
//   need to configure the device.
// 
//   WinUsb is a native Windows device driver, so this interface
//   doesn't require the user to install any drivers; just plug
//   in the device and Windows will recognize this interface and
//   make it available to applications.  WinUsb by design only
//   allows one application to access the interface at a time,
//   which shouldn't be a hardship for Config Tool-like programs.
//   (WinUsb access doesn't lock out access to any of the OTHER
//   USB interfaces that the device exposes, so running the
//   Config Tool won't block DOF from accessing the device.)
// 
//   The vendor interface API also provides helpers for discovery
//   of Pico devices in their native "Boot Loader" mode, in which
//   the Pico emulates a USB thumb drive for the purpose of
//   installing new firmware into the Pico's flash memory.
//
//   See PinscapeVendorInterface.h for this interface.
// 
// - A Feedback Controller interface, which provides application
//   access to the feedback devices (lights, solenoids, etc)
//   attached to the Pinscape Pico's output ports.  This interface
//   is designed for use by DOF and other programs that generate
//   feedback effects.
// 
//   The Feedback Controller is a HID interface, which makes it
//   driverless and shareable (multiple applications can access
//   it concurrently).  That's why it's a separate interface
//   from the Configuration and Control interface.  The DOF-type
//   functions of the Feedback Controller interface are for use
//   by games and other UI-oriented programs, and the user is
//   likely to run more than one at a time, either because one
//   program launches another (e.g., PinballY launching VP),
//   or because the programs are taking turns in the foreground.
//   Allowing concurrent access to the DOF-type functions avoids
//   conflicts that can be difficult for users to troubleshoot.
// 
//   See FeedbackControllerInterface.h for this interface.

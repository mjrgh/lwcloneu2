// Pinscape Pico - Vendor Interface API
// Copyright 2024 Michael J Roberts / BSD-3-Clause license, 2025 / NO WARRANTY
//
// This module implements an API for interacting with the Pinscape
// Pico device via its USB Vendor Interface.  This interface provides
// configuration, control, and testing functions.  It's designed for
// programs such as the Pinscape Pico Config Tool that implement
// interactive access to configuration and test functions.
// 
// To access the vendor interface, the first step is to enumerate
// available devices:
// 
//    std::list<PinscapePico::VendorInterfaceDesc> devices;
//    HRESULT hr = PinscapePico::VendorInterface::EnumerateDevices(devices);
//    if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
//       ...
//
// Now you can open a device from the enumeration list:
// 
//    PinscapePico::VendorInterface *vi = nullptr;
//    hr = devices.front().Open(vi);
//    if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
//       ...
// 
// Alternatively, you can open a device by specific unit number,
// unit name, or Pico hardware ID, if you already know which device
// you want to access:
// 
//    hr = VendorInterface::Open(vi, 1);  // open unit #1
// 
// Another approach is to first enumerate Feedback Controller
// interfaces, then use the hardware ID from that interface to
// select a Vendor Interface to open.  That approach lets you
// display more information to user to make an interactive device
// selection.  That has the advantage that the Feedback Controller
// interface can query device information in "shared" mode, without
// the need for an exclusive WinUsb connection (as the vendor
// interface requires).  The Vendor Interface enumerator can't
// obtain any detail on the device beyond its Windows device path,
// which isn't meaningful to a user and thus can't be used for
// interactive device selection.  You can query the same identifier
// information via the Vendor Interface, but only *after* opening
// the WinUsb connection.
// 
// Once you've opened the Vendor Interface object, you can use its
// member functions to query information from the device, change
// configuration settings, and run various tests.  Note that the
// WinUsb connection is inherently exclusive, meaning that only one
// application can open a WinUsb connection to the device at a time.
// The WinUsb connection doesn't affect concurrent access to any of
// the other USB interfaces, though, so this won't block other
// programs that use gamepad or keyboard input or the Feedback
// Controller interface.
//
// 
// The term "vendor interface" is a USB-ism, describing a USB wire
// protocol that's defined by the device manufacturer rather than
// conforming to one of the pre-defined standard USB "classes", such
// as HID, CRC, or mass storage.  Vendor interfaces are generally
// accessed on the host through mating kernel device drivers, but
// Windows and Linux also both provide application-level (user mode)
// access through "generic" USB drivers.  Windows provides a built-in
// generic driver called WinUsb, which is how this API accesses the
// device.  On Linux, an open source library called libusb provides
// similar generic driver access.  This code only works with WinUsb;
// it could be adapted to libusb with some work, since libusb and
// WinUsb are conceptually pretty equivalent, but the details are
// all completely different between the two, naturally.  The reason
// that we chose WinUsb rather than libusb as the basis for this
// code is that WinUsb is built in to all Windows systems from
// Windows 7 onward, so it provides a transparent, driverless,
// plug-and-play install experience for the user, whereas libusb
// requires some manual steps to download and install third-party
// device drivers.
//
// The API also provides functions for discovering Pico devices
// that are currently in RP2 Boot Loader mode, which makes it
// possible for a client program to automate the process of
// installing new firmware on a Pico.  The RP2 Boot Loader is the
// Pico's native ROM-based boot loader.  It's a built-in feature
// of the Pico (actually of the CPU itself), so it's always
// available for any Pico, whether or not any Pinscape software
// is involved.  When the RP2 Boot Loader is active, it exposes
// a virtual disk drive on the USB interface.  Firmware can be
// installed onto the Pico simply by copying a UF2 file (the
// Pico's equivalent of a Windows EXE) onto the RP2 virtual disk.
// 
// One of the functions that you can access through the Pinscape
// Configuration and Control API is a "reboot into RP2" command,
// which resets the Pico and places it in RP2 mode.  After
// invoking this function, you can use the RP2 discovery function
// to find the device's virtual disk, and then copy a UF2 file
// onto the disk to install new firmware.  The Pico automatically
// resets and launches the new firmware after the UF2 is copied,
// so the entire firmware update process can be automated,
// without the need for any user intervention.
// 
// Note that a user can always manually activate the RP2 Boot
// Loader, by power-cycling the Pico while holding down the
// BOOTSEL button (the small pushbutton on top of the Pico).
// The RP2 boot loader and BOOTSEL button are hard-wired
// features of the Pico, so it's impossible for software to
// block user activation of the boot loader, which in turn makes
// it impossible to brick a Pico with errant software.  If the
// automated Config Tool update process ever fails, the user
// can use the BOOTSEL feature to perform a manual re-install.

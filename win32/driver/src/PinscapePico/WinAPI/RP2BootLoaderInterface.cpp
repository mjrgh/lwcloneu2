// Pinscape Pico Device - Boot Loader interface
// Copyright 2024 Michael J Roberts / BSD-3-Clause license, 2025 / NO WARRANTY
//
// Implements helper functions for working with a Pico in its native
// Boot Loader mode.  The Boot Loader is built into every Pico, in ROM
// embedded in the RP2040 CPU, so it's always available without any
// software installation required, and can't be erased or corrupted by
// errant firmware.  In Boot Loader mode, the Pico exposes a USB MSC
// "virtual thumb drive" interface, where it appears as a FAT-formatted
// removable drive.  It's only an emulated FAT drive; it can't actually
// store or retrieve arbitrary files.  It will accept a host-to-device
// file transfer for a file in UF2 format:
//
//   https://github.com/microsoft/uf2
// 
// It also provides a fake directory listing with a couple of files
// required by the UF2 spec, which the host can read to get information
// on the device.
// 
// This interface provides functions to enumerate the Pico Boot Loader
// devices currently attached, and to send UF2 files to the device.
// UF2 transfers can be used to install firmware or simply to write
// arbitrary data to specified locations in the Pico's flash.  This
// allows the host to store application data separately from the
// firmware program image.  Note, however, that the Pico's flash
// doesn't have any sort of file system or other structure; it's just
// an unformatted array of bytes.  The only structure is the simple
// program image layout implied by the way the boot loader launches
// firmware on Pico reset, which requires the program's startup code
// to be located at a certain point in flash space.  Beyond that, a
// linker can arrange the program layout however it wishes, and
// applications can use any space not allocated by the linker for
// data storage.

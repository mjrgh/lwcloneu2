		// for a list of current RP2 Boot devices and store it as the
		// "before" list.  Now ask the user to plug in the new device
		// (holding down the BOOTSEL button to enter boot loader mode).
		// Scan periodically (say, every 500ms) for new devices; when a
		// single new device appears, it's fairly safe to assume that
		// it's the Pico that the user just plugged in.
		//
		// - Updating the Pinscape firmware on an existing Pico.  When
		// the user initiates the update, do a scan to build a "before"
		// list of any already-attached devices, then send a BOOTSEL
		// command to the Pinscape firmware via its USB control
		// interface.  Now scan periodically (e.g., at 500ms intervals)
		// for new boot devices.  When a single new device appears, we
		// can assume that it's the Pico that we commanded to reboot
		// into the boot loader.
		// 
		// In both cases, the caller should make sure that exactly one
		// new device appeared in the "after" scan.  If more than one
		// device appears, it's impossible to know which is the correct
		// target device.  This should be considered an error condition
		// requiring user intervention, either by the user manually
		// unplugging the "other" devices, or by the user identifying
		// the desired target device via a list presented in the UI.
		// 
		// We leave it up to the client program to provide a periodic
		// scanning mechanism, because that will require a timed wait
		// that has to be coordinated with the program's UI layer.  A
		// simple blocking wait routine here would be unusable for most

	// The firmware in real LedWiz units seems to have a serious bug
	// in its USB interface that allows an incoming packet to overwrite
	// the previous packet while the previous packet is still being
	// decoded.  The bug is triggered if writes are sent too quickly.
	// It manifests as output ports being set to random brightness
	// levels and random on/off values, since the packet decoder
	// incorrectly tries to read some of the bytes from the newer
	// packet as though they were part of the previous packet.
	// There's no way to completely avoid this bug, since we don't
	// have control over the exact timing of data going out on the
	// USB wire; there are many layers of Windows APIs and device
	// drivers between us and the wire.  However, it does help to
	// throttle our write rate.  This at least mitigates the bug
	// considerably.  A delay time of 5-10 ms generally makes the
	// bug infrequent enough not to be bothersome, although the
	// padding needed can increase depending on what other software
	// is running in the system, probably because other processes can
	// affect the actual wire data timing somewhat.

	//
	// LedWiz emulators (such as an Arduino running LWCloneU2, or a
	// KL25Z running the Pinscape controller software) generally do
	// NOT suffer from this problem.  The bug clearly seems to be in
	// the real LedWiz firmware.  It's NOT a bug in Windows, the USB
	// drivers, the USB hardware, or any other potential suspects.
	// USB is such a black box that it's easy to think this is just
	// some general USB flakiness, but it can easily be shown that
	// it's not, such as by comparing Pinscape unit behavior.  The
	// known emulators don't have the bug and don't need the delay.
	// We therefore allow the caller to set/ the timing per device,
	// in case it wants to look at the USB HID descriptors to
	// determine exactly what kind of physical device we're
	// addressing and choose the delay timing accordingly.
	// For a real LedWiz, the timing should be 5 to 10 ms.  For 
	// an emulator, it can be 0 ms.
